Feature: Image sync between regions using GlanceSync in the same federation with 'forcesync' mode.
  As a sys-admin of FIWARE federation
  I want to sync images from master node to other nodes in the federation although sync conditions are not complied (master)
  So that I can use the same base images in all nodes and keep them updated

  Scenario: Sync an image although it does not comply sync conditions: Non-public images. No checksum conflicts.
    Given a new image created in the Glance of master node with name "qatesting01" and these properties:
            | param_name      | param_value         |
            | is_public       | False               |

    When  I sync the image
    Then  all images are synchronized
    And   the image "qatesting01" is present in all nodes with the content of file "qatesting01"
    And   the properties values of the image "qatesting01" in all target nodes are the following:
