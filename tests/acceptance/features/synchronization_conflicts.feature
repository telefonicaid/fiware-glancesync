Feature: Image sync between regions using GlanceSync in the same federation when conflicts happen (checksum).
  As a sys-admin of FIWARE federation
  I want to sync images from master node to other nodes in the federation using 'custom' properties to manage conflicts
  So that I can use the same base images in all nodes and keep them updated (replace, rename, dontupdate)

  Scenario: Sync images when there are checksum conflicts: replace. Image without metadata.
    Given a new image created in the Glance of master node with name "qatesting01"
    And   GlanceSync configured to sync images using these configuration parameters:
            | config_section  | config_key          | config_value          |
            | DEFAULT         | metadata_condition  | 'image.is_public'     |
            | DEFAULT         | metadata_set        |                       |
            | DEFAULT         | replace             | checksum(qatesting01) |
    And   already synchronized images
    And   the image "qatesting01" is deleted from the Glance of master node
    And   other new image created in the Glance of master node with name "qatesting01" and file "qatesting01b"
    When  I sync the image
    Then  all images are replaced
    And   the image "qatesting01" is present in all nodes with the content of file "qatesting01b"
