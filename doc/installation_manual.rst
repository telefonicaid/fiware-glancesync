Installation
------------

At the moment, Glancesync is designed to run in the glance server of the master region, because it reads the images that are stored directly in the filesystem. This will be fixed in a future version.  

It's not necessary to install the software, after unzipping the package or running 'git clone' the tool is ready to work.

Glancesync works mainly as a front-end to the glance and keystone python tool, therefore they must be installed (note that in Essex OpenStack release, python-glanceclient was named as glance-client):::

   $ apt-get install python-glanceclient python-keystoneclient

Configuration file is optional, but its default location is */etc/glancesync.conf*. Another path may be set with ``GLANCESYNC_CONF`` environment variable.

Security considerations
_______________________

Glancesyncs does not require root access. At this version it requires read-only access to image directory */var/lib/glance/images*

It is strongly recommended:

* creating an account to run glancesync only
* creating a configuration file only readable by the glancesync account. This is because the credentials should not be exposed to other users.
